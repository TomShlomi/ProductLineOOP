# Product Line
A simulated product line manager. It simulated software that might be used in a factory to keep track of object production. It has four tabs, Employee, Product Line, Produce, and Production Log. The Employee tabs includes ways for employee to login, logout, and create an account. Product Line allows the addition of new types of products. The Produce tab allows the user to record the production of some number of a certain type of product, as well as see statistics on the products produced. The former function does not work unless an employee is logged in. The Production Log tab displays all of the products produced, as well as relevant data such as time produced and the id of the employee who logged the production.

This was built by me, with substantial guidance and assitance from my professor and classmates, for my COP 3003 Object-Oriented programming class in fall 2019.

## Getting Started

Pulling this project from GitHub should allow the program to be run and further edits to be made.

## Built With

This was built using IntelliJ IDEA to develop Java code and SceneBuilder to develop FXML.

## Contributing

This code is entirely self-contained; it cannot read external inputs. Further development could include the ability to integrate this code with some other programs.

## History


## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

This assignment required the utilization of many concepts and techniques object-oriented programming, including: inheritance, which allowed me to use the methods defined in the Product classes in its various subclasses; working with GUIs; and error handling, since the user can input data in all sorts of awful ways.
